#summary Why did I Write This Program

= Introduction =

In a lot of cases, people ask, "why did you make this?".  In my case it was for several reasons:

  * I needed a quick and dirty translator for work
  * I wanted something simple and clean for my first try using http://code.google.com.
  * I wanted to have something small while learning GPL 2.0

= For Work =

The translator is handy because I tend to IM with other countries.  My English is good but my foreign languages are so-so.  This program comes in handy when I need to send a quick message that might be harder for them to translate.  So far it has been very useful for me.

= Google Code =

I have had to do a bit of re-work here and there to get this to look and work right on http://code.google.com.   Nothing big but this is the right sized project for such changes.  There will be more to come.  Then I can use hat I learned when submitting bigger and more interesting projects.

= GPL =

This is still not 100% clear in my world however, I have just about everything in place.  I will do more research to get it right.

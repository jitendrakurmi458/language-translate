# Introduction #

You may notice that the JNLP launch is pointing to http://home.columbus.rr.com/webstart/...

Google Code is nice and easy to use however, they do not host your binaries.  I have the source in [Google Code's Subversion area](http://code.google.com/p/language-translate/source) but the binaries are on a [different server](http://home.columbus.rr.com/webstart/languagetranslate_1-x/)

Don't be alarmed by this.  It is just what I needed to do to get JAVA WebStart to work.

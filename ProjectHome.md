This program is a wrapper for Google's Language Tools site.  It allows you to quickly and simply translate text from one language to another using a split pane interface.  The program is currently launched using Java WebStart, however, it can be run locally.

All development was done using the Netbeans  (http://www.netbeans.org) IDE and SUN Java JRE 6.0 (http://java.sun.com).   The actual language translation is done by our friends Google (http://www.google.com/language_tools).

You can launch this program from the [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/language-translate/downloads/list) tab.
